# kbb-cross-tekken
This is a final project for a class in my University.

Due to usage of assets that won't become public property until the latest version of [Kirby Battle Blitz](https://gamejolt.com/games/KBB/578480) (one of the games this is based on; and a fangame I work on as a lead developer), version 3.0.0, releases, after this is graded, this repository may likely become private until said version of the game is publicly released. 

(If by rare chance you are someone from said class that has github, however, I don't mind giving you access to the repo after it's made private however, just let me know :3)
